I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). At UMN, I am fortunate to be advised by [Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/). My research is funded by the [**Amazon ML Systems Fellowship**](https://azalahmadkhan.github.io) and [**Departmental GAGE Fellowship**](https://azalahmadkhan.github.io). I'll be spending summer at [NEC Labs America](https://www.nec-labs.com/) working with [Vijay Kumar](https://vijaykbg.github.io/) and [Manmohan Chandraker](https://www.nec-labs.com/research/media-analytics/people/manmohan-chandraker/).

My research focuses on reasoning and coordination in LLM agents. I am interested in how multiple agents can collaborate to solve complex tasks more efficiently. Prior to joining UMN, I spent four beautiful years completing undergrad at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India. During my undergrad, I worked with [Debanga Raj Neog](https://debanga.github.io/), [Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/), and [Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra).
