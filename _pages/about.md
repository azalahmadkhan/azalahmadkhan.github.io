I am an incoming first-year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). At UMN, I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Dr. Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/) and [Dr. Jon Weissman](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~weiss039/). My research is partially funded by the Departmental GAGE Fellowship. Prior to joining UMN, I spent four beautiful years completing undergraduate studies at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Dr. Debanga Raj Neog](https://debanga.github.io/) on my Bachelor Thesis on Large Language Models (LLMs). I also worked with [Dr. Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/) on Personalization and Optimization in Federated Learning, and with [Dr. Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra) on ML and optimization.

My current research focuses on the alignment of LLMs, including their applications and multi-objective alignment. I am also working on reasoning in LLMs. Additionally, I am working on developing LLM agents designed to assist software engineers in their daily tasks. More updates on this will be shared soon.
