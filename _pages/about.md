I am a final year undergraduate student in [Department of Chemistry](https://www.iitg.ac.in/chem/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). At IIT Guwahati, I am advised by [Dr. Debanga Raj Neog](https://debanga.github.io/) for my Bachelor Thesis on the intersection of Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning.

I am mentored by [Dr. Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/) at [DMLSys (Distributed Machine Learning and Systems) Lab](https://chalianwar.github.io/lab/) at the University of Minnesota. I am a member of the [Transitional Artificial Intelligence Research Group](https://transitional-ai.github.io/) at the University of New South Wales, where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra).
